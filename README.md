Hate Speech Detection Using Random Forest
This project aims to detect hate speech in text data using a Random Forest classifier. Hate speech detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) that helps to identify and filter harmful or offensive language from online platforms and communities.

Project Overview
The project utilizes a machine learning approach to classify text as either hateful or non-hateful using a Random Forest model. The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method that aggregates multiple decision trees to make predictions. This approach is well-suited for text classification tasks due to its robustness and ability to handle large datasets.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Cleans the raw text by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing stemming or lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Converts the text data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Model Training: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier to train on labeled hate speech and non-hate speech data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
matplotlib
seaborn
joblib (for saving models)

Dataset
This project uses a publicly available dataset containing labeled examples of hate speech and non-hate speech. You can find the dataset in the data/ directory (or you may use your own dataset). The dataset should be in CSV format with at least two columns:

text: The text to classify.
label: A binary label where 1 indicates hate speech and 0 indicates non-hate speech.
Example:

text	label
"I hate you all!"	1
"I love programming, it's so much fun!"	0
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset and preprocess the text data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
Train the Model: Use the train_model.py script to train the Random Forest classifier on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: After training, evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Prediction: Use the trained model to classify new text samples by running the predict.py script.

Model Performance
The model's performance can be evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
